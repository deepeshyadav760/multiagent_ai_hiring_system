# AI-Powered Recruiting & Talent Screening System

An autonomous, multi-agent platform for end-to-end technical recruitment, featuring AI-powered matching, proactive sourcing, and automated, proctored interviews.

This project demonstrates a full-stack application that leverages a crew of specialized AI agents, built with CrewAI, to automate the entire hiring lifecycle. From resume ingestion and intelligent scoring to conducting real-time conversational interviews, this system is designed to make recruiting faster, fairer, and more insightful.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent System (Hierarchical Pattern)
---

## ✨ Core Features

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Powered by CrewAI, the system uses a team of specialized agents (Orchestrator, Parsing, Matching, Interviewer, etc.) working together under a Master Control Protocol (MCP) to manage a robust, sequential workflow.

- 🎯 **Intelligent Job Matching**: Goes beyond keywords. Uses a two-stage process combining the speed of FAISS vector similarity search with the deep contextual understanding of Llama 3 to score candidates with high accuracy.

- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Interviews**: Shortlisted candidates are invited to a real-time, conversational interview conducted by an AI. The system handles question generation, speech-to-text (via Whisper), and final evaluation.

- 👁️ **AI-Powered Proctoring**: The interview room uses client-side AI (face-api.js) to monitor the candidate's video feed, ensuring a fair and focused assessment environment by detecting multiple people.

- 🚀 **Proactive Sourcing**: When a new job is posted, a dedicated Sourcing Agent automatically scans the entire database of past candidates (within the last year) to find and re-engage qualified talent.

- ⚖️ **Built-in Compliance**: A Compliance Agent scans every resume for potentially biasing information (related to age, gender, ethnicity) and logs a risk report, promoting fair and equitable hiring practices.

- 🌐 **Full-Stack Application**: Features a clean, responsive frontend dashboard and a powerful FastAPI backend, ready for deployment.

- 🔗 **Automated Ingestion**: Seamlessly processes new candidates from a manual resume upload feature or via a connected Google Form.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The project is built on a modern, scalable, and cost-effective tech stack.

### Backend
- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Agentic Framework:** CrewAI
- **AI Models:**
  - **LLM:** Groq (Llama 3)
  - **Speech-to-Text:** `faster-whisper`
  - **Embeddings:** `sentence-transformers`
- **Databases:** MongoDB (Primary), FAISS (Vector Search)

### Frontend
- **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Browser APIs:** Fetch, WebSockets, MediaRecorder, SpeechSynthesis
- **AI Proctoring:** `face-api.js` (Client-Side)

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Frontend:** Vercel
- **Backend:** Render (Recommended for WebSocket support)
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
- **Development Tunneling:** `ngrok`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB installed and running locally, or a MongoDB Atlas cluster
- A Groq API Key
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/agentic-ai-hr-system.git
cd agentic-ai-hr-system
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend

#### Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv recruit_venv

# On Windows
recruit_venv\Scripts\Activate

# On macOS/Linux
source recruit_venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Configure environment variables:

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add the following:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY="your_groq_api_key"
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"  # Or your MongoDB Atlas connection string
FRONTEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5500"

# Add any other secrets like email passwords, etc.
```

#### Run the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend

#### Download Face-API Models:

The client-side proctoring requires pre-trained models. Create a `models` folder inside the `frontend` directory and place the necessary `face-api.js` model files there.

#### Serve the frontend:

**Option 1 - Using VS Code:**
- Install the "Live Server" extension
- Right-click on `frontend/index.html`
- Choose "Open with Live Server"

**Option 2 - Using Python:**
```bash
python -m http.server 5500
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5500/frontend/`.

The application dashboard should now be live and connected to your local backend.
